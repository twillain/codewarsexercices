# Code Wars Exercises

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises sourced from the Code Wars (https://www.codewars.com/) platform.
Each exercise is organized into separate packages, with the package names corresponding to the names of the challenges on Code Wars.

## Important Notes:
- Not all exercises are fully functional. Some of them may be incomplete or contain bugs.
- The repository is intended to serve as a personal reference or practice material, and as such, the code may not always meet best practices or performance standards.

Feel free to explore the exercises !
